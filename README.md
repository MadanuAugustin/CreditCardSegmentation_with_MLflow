## Credit Card Segmentation Project_with_MLflow

This project focuses on using machine learning techniques to segment credit card customers. Segmenting credit card customers is crucial for optimizing marketing strategies, personalizing customer experiences, and enhancing financial services. By employing machine learning algorithms, this project aims to accurately segment credit card customers based on relevant features such as spending behavior, demographics, and credit history.

### Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to develop reliable segmentation models that accurately classify credit card customers into distinct groups. These models will assist financial institutions, marketers, and service providers in understanding and meeting the needs of different customer segments more effectively.

### Dataset:
The project utilizes a comprehensive dataset containing relevant attributes such as transaction history, credit scores, demographic information, and spending patterns. This dataset serves as the foundation for training and evaluating the machine learning models.

### Techniques:
Machine learning algorithms and techniques explored in this project include:
- KMeans

### Evaluation:
The performance of the models is evaluated using metrics such as silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, and inertia. Techniques such as cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning are employed to enhance the models' reliability and applicability across different customer segments.
